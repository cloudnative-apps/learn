# Microservices



## Introducton
Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

* Highly maintainable and testable
* Loosely coupled
* Independently deployable
* Organized around business capabilities
* Owned by a small team

The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
