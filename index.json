Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better. Algolia Atomic is a good choice.

You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order.

To avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown’s design philosophy.

principles Codebase: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys. Dependencies: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies. Config: Store config in the environment. Backing services: Treat backing services as attached resources. Build, release, and Run: Strictly separate build and run stages. Processes: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes. Port binding: Export services via port binding. Concurrency: Scale out via the process model. Disposability: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown. Dev/prod parity: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible. Logs: Treat logs as event streams. Admin processes: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes. Codebase Every application should have its own codebase. Multiple codebases for multiple versions must be avoided. Multiple apps sharing the same code are a violation of the twelve-factor In Microservices, every service should have its own codebase. Having an independent codebase helps you to easy CI/CD process for your applications. If you need to share you need to build a library and make it as a dependency and manage through package repository like maven, nuget Dependencies Explicitly Declare and Isolate the Dependencies A twelve-factor app never relies on implicit existence of system-wide packages Consider the dependencies from the operating system/ execution environment perspective as well. Microservices: All the application packages will be managed through package managers like sbt, maven. In non-containerized environments, you can go for configuration management tools like chef, ansible, etc. to install system-level dependencies. For a containerized environment, you can go for dockerfile. Config Do not hardcode configuration values as constants in the codebase. This is a violation of 12-factor app principles. It advocates the strict separation between the code and configurations. The code must be the same irrespective of where the application being deployed. Backing Services Treat Backing Resources as Attached Resources Database, Message Brokers, Cache, Logging, any other external systems that the app communicates is treated as Backing service. 12-factor app can automatically swap the application from one provider to another without making any further modifications to the code base. Only configuration change should be able to take care of it. In a microservice ecosystem, anything external to service is treated as attached resource. The resource can be swapped at any given point of time without impacting the service. Build, Release, and Run Strictly Separate Build and Run Stages Build stage: transform the code into an executable bundle/ build package. Release stage: get the build package from the build stage and combines with the configurations of the deployment environment and make your application ready to run. Run stage: It is like running your app in the execution environment. The application must have a strict separation between the build, release, and run stages. Let us understand each stage in more detail. Microservices: You can use CI/CD tools to automate the builds and deployment process. Docker images make it easy to separate the build, release, and run stages more efficiently. Processes Execute the App as One or More Stateless Processes Application should store the state in the database instead of in memory of the process. Avoid using sticky sessions For storing session information, use any cache provider. Port Binding Export Services Via Port Binding The twelve-factor app is completely self-contained and doesn’t rely on runtime injection of a webserver into the execution environment to create a web-facing service. The web app exports HTTP as a service by binding to a port, and listening to requests coming in on that port. Concurrency Scale Out Via the Process Model Consider running your application as multiple processes/instances instead of running in one large system (Horizontal scalin","date":"2022-03-12","objectID":"/12-principles-of-cloudnave-app/:0:1","tags":["Cloud","Cloud Native","12 Factor App","Cloud App","Cloud Migrations"],"title":"12 Factor Principles of Cloudnative Apps ","uri":"/12-principles-of-cloudnave-app/"},{"categories":["Cloud Native","Design Principles"],"content":"References: https://12factor.net/ https://www.nginx.com/blog/microservices-reference-architecture-nginx-twelve-factor-app/ https://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/07/17/successful-microservices-with-12factor-app.html https://dzone.com/articles/12-factor-app-principles-and-cloud-native-microser https://tyk.io/blog/being-cloud-native-12-factor-app-design/ ","date":"2022-03-12","objectID":"/12-principles-of-cloudnave-app/:0:2","tags":["Cloud","Cloud Native","12 Factor App","Cloud App","Cloud Migrations"],"title":"12 Factor Principles of Cloudnative Apps ","uri":"/12-principles-of-cloudnave-app/"},{"categories":["Azure","Cloud"],"content":"Azure Core Concepts IAAS PAAS FAAS ","date":"2022-03-09","objectID":"/azure/:0:1","tags":["Cloud","Azure","Exam","AZ-104"],"title":"Azure","uri":"/azure/"},{"categories":["Azure","Cloud"],"content":"Azure Compute Azure compute is an on-demand computing services for running cloud based applications.

This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline’s output becomes the input of the following pipe. Because of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline. A few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe. Example 1 : {{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }} is the same as {{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }} It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes. Example 2 : {{ index .Params \"disqus_url\" | html }} Access the page parameter called “disqus_url” and escape the HTML. Example 3 : {{ if or (or (isset .Params \"title\") (isset .Params \"caption\")) (isset .Params \"attr\")}} Stuff Here {{ end }} Could be rewritten as {{ isset .Params \"caption\" | or isset .Params \"title\" | or isset .Params \"attr\" | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }} ","date":"2022-01-01","objectID":"/graph-ql/:7:0","tags":["Graph QL","Type","Query"],"title":"Graph QL","uri":"/graph-ql/"},{"categories":["API","Microservices","Graph QL"],"content":"Context (aka. the dot) The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context. Example: {{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u003cli\u003e \u003ca href=\"{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\"\u003e{{ . }}\u003c/a\u003e - {{ $title }} \u003c/li\u003e {{ end }} Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop. Hugo Parameters Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content.

All Rights Reserved.\"TwitterUser:\"spf13\"SidebarRecentLimit:5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u003cfooter\u003e which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates. {{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u003cfooter\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"text-center\"\u003e{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u003c/div\u003e \u003c/footer\u003e{{end}} An alternative way of writing the “if” and then referencing the same value is to use “with” instead.
