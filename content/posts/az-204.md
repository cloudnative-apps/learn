### Azure Compute
Azure compute is an on-demand computing services for running cloud based applications.
<!--more-->

* Azure Virtual Machines
* Azure Container Instances
* Azure App Service
* Azure Functions (or serverless computing)



#### Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

Virtual Machines are virtual computer systems. They include 
* Virtual processor 
* Memory
* Storage
* Networking resources
VMs host an opertaing system, and we can install and run softwares on the VMs just like a physical computer.
VMs provide IaaS (infrastructure as a service).

#### Storage
 * OS Disk
 * Data Disk
 * Temporary Disk (instance)
 * Unmanaged vs managed
 #### Operating System
 * Windows
 * Linux
 #### Connections to VMs
 * RDP
 * SSH
